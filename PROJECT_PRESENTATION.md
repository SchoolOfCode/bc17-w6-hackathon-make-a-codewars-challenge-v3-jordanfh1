## Welcome gamblers, nerds and mathematicians ðŸŽ²


- Kata Interactive Studios, needs a digital dice-rolling feature for the company's new virtual tabletop casino roll playing game. 

- The game needs to simulate the randomness of physical dice rolls for various types of dice, from traditional six-sided dice to more complex multi-sided variants used in role-playing games. 

- They need to ensure that the feature was accurate, efficient, and could easily handle multiple dice rolls at once, as players often roll several dice in a single turn.

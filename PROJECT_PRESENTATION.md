## Welcome gamblers, nerds and mathematicians ðŸŽ²


- Kata Interactive, a gaming company, was tasked with creating a digital dice-rolling function for the company's new virtual tabletop gambling casino roll playing game. 

- The game needed to simulate the randomness of physical dice rolls for various types of dice, from traditional six-sided dice to more complex multi-sided variants used in role-playing games. 

- The company's goal was to provide players with an authentic gaming experience, where every roll felt as unpredictable and exciting as it would with real dice. 

- KI needed to ensure that the function was accurate, efficient, and could easily handle multiple dice rolls at once, as players often roll several dice in a single turn. 

- This functionality would be a critical component of the game's mechanics, directly impacting the player's experience and the overall success of the game.
